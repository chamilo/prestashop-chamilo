## What's this? ##

This plugin integrates into [Prestashop](http://www.prestashop.com) to let you sell accesses to [Chamilo](http://www.chamilo.org) 1.8.8.2 (or superior) courses from your Prestashop portal. This is the first e-commerce plugin available for Chamilo.

Prestashop and Chamilo are both GNU/GPL'ed software, so you are free to download, use, study, modify and share these as you like provided you follow the license obligation (maintain authorship and license compatibility).

## Get it! ##

Download the Chamilo plugin from the left column (where it says "**.zip") and follow the InstallationGuide. If you have Prestashop and Chamilo portals running, you should be all setup in less than 15 minutes!**

Note: For Prestashop 1.4, download version 1.2 of this plugin (hidden in the additional downloads). For Prestashop 1.5, just download the current plugin (1.3).

If you don't know what Prestashop and Chamilo are but you still want to sell courses online, you should definitely get to their respective websites and learn more about them first. Optionally, you can also hire a pro (see support section below) to get you up and running quickly.
