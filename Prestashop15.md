# Solving a compatibility issue with NUSOAP

We've been reported an issue with Prestashop 1.5, which is related to the use of a different version of NUSOAP.

A fix is available here (just coipy the file and replace it in your code): http://code.google.com/p/prestashop-chamilo/source/detail?r=da5fb61dc54ae14347eccf70c1c0c2adf59d42a0

This should also work with Chamilo 1.9.
